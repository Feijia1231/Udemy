Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int. 

Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.

The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false.


EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

* hasSharedDigit(12, 23); → should return true since the digit 2 appears in both numbers

* hasSharedDigit(9, 99); → should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-99

* hasSharedDigit(15, 55); → should return true since the digit 5 appears in both numbers

public class SharedDigit {
    public static boolean hasSharedDigit(int number1, int number2) {
        if ((number1 < 10 || number1 > 99) || (number2 < 10 || number2 > 99)) {
            return false;
        }
        int Digit1 = 0;
        int Digit2 = 0;
        while (number1 != 0) {
             Digit1 = number1 % 10;
            while (number2 != 0) {
                Digit2 = number2 % 10;
                if (Digit1 == Digit2) {
                    return true;
                }
                number2 /= 10;
            }
            if (Digit1 == Digit2) return true;
            number1 /= 10;
        }return false;
    }
}
